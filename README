Description:

This program is designed to simulate client and server interaction through TCP transmission and fragmentation.
Upon executing, the client initiates the 3-way handshake to define the connection between server and client, followed
by the fragmentation of an input file that is relayed to the server. The client finally initiates the 4-way
closing process with the server. The contents of each packet are updated as the interaction progresses.

How to Compile:

	gcc server.c -o svr
	gcc client.c -o cli

How to Run:

	./svr
	./cli
